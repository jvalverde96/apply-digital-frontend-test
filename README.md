# Apply Digital - Frontend Challenge

## Description

This project is a responsive web application built to demonstrate proficiency in React and Next.js, adhering to the provided design and functionality requirements. It includes a catalog of games fetched from a local API, with features like genre-based filtering, pagination, and a shopping cart. The app is deployed on Vercel and designed to be both functional and visually appealing while following best practices in frontend development.

Note: I implemented real pagination instead of the "see more" functionality, as the latter didn't align well with the concept of pagination. Additionally, the fetching logic was designed for a real pagination scenario, including support for total pages and the current page

## Features

### General

* Persistent Cart: Items added to the cart are stored in local storage to maintain state across sessions.
* Responsive Design: The UI adapts to various screen sizes for optimal usability.
* Custom Styling: Uses TailwindCSS for consistent design, adhering to the provided configuration file.
* Environment Variables: API URLs and other environment-specific settings are managed through .env files.
* Deployment: Fully deployed and accessible via Vercel.

### Catalog Page

* Game Listings: Displays a list of games with their details, such as name, description, price, and a "New" label for new items.
* Genre Filtering: Games can be filtered by genre using a dropdown selector, with the selected filter persisted in the URL.
* Pagination: Pagination functionality to load additional games using the page parameter.
* Add/Remove from Cart: Each game has an "Add to Cart" or "Remove" button based on its cart status.
